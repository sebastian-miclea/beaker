# [4.21.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/compare/4.20.0...4.21.0) - 2020-03-31

### Added

- Empty file `/etc/environment` while preparing ssh environment on Ubuntu 20.04 to keep the current behavior and consider all variables from `~/.ssh/environment`. ([#1635](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/1635))

# [4.20.0](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/compare/4.19.0...4.20.0) - 2020-03-19

### Added

### Added

- `apt-transport-https` package will now be installed on Debian-based systems as part of the prebuilt process. ([#1631](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/1631))
- Ubuntu 19.10 and 20.04 code name handling. ([#1632](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/1632))

### Changed

- The `wait_time`, `max_connection_tries`, and `uptime_retries` parameters have been added to `Host::Unix::Exec.reboot`. This allows for more fine-grained control over how the reboot is handled. ([#1625](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/pull/1625))
